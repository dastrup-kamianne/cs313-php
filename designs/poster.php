         These posters were designed to represent the late artist, Eva Zeisel.
         Eva Zeisel lived to be 105 years old and kept producing art until the 
         day she died. Her work consisted mostly of pottery and glass. These 
         posters advertise a fictitious event to be held in her honor to 
         commemorate her works and contribution to the art community.
