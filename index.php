     <p>Welcome to Dastrup Development! Website development is my passion, and 
     what better way to share my passion than creating a website? Take a look
     around my site to see some of my previous work, learn about the person
     behind the site and contact me with any questions or comments you may have.</p><br>
     <p>This site is still under construction, so please check 
         back often. I will add new projects as they are completed. Some of my
     latest updates are featured under the Design tab. So if you have been here
     before, be sure to check out my newest features there!</p><br>
     
     <h2>Thanks for stopping by!</h2>
